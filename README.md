<p align="center"> Welcome to Puppy Collector. This is a Django app is similar to the Battleship board game but has some Christmas-styled twists to it.
</p>

## üßê About

I decided to build this because Battleship is one of the best pencil and paper games. In addition, Christmas is both the best holiday of the year and my middle name. As a result, this project was built to combine the two.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Visit https://battleship-kory-fitzgerald.netlify.app to play the game.

### Prerequisites

Access to the internet is required.<br>
